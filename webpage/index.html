    <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
    <p> Create a web application that acts like a scoreboard for competitive games. The goal of the project is to become more familiar with web application development using an JavaScript front end framework, backend framework as well as either a relational or NoSQL database.
        Goals are to implement Discord integration and use its features for logging in to the application and display profiles. Other goals include setting up parts or the whole project in a docker container allowing project members to easily set up their environment, an initial goal would be to have the database as a container
